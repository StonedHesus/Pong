This here folder contains a project whose scope is to mimic the original Atari first released in nineteen seventy-two,
by the aforementioned company(Atari). The games description goes as follows, for those unaware of this staple in the
industry, and a steeping stone in the evolution of the game industry; the game is a player versus player competition
style game, where each player controls a paddle, which they utilise so as to fit a ball, thus propulsating it thru the
screen, if any of the players fails to parry the ball as it comes towards him or her, and thus it exits the screen, then
the player responsible for the shoot earns a point; the player which earn the required number of points to win is
reign victorious over the other. We easily seen that this here game is supposed to simulate a ping-pong or tennis game.
